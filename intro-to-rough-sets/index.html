            <p>In computer science, a rough set, first described by Polish computer scientist Zdzisław I. Pawlak, is a
                formal approximation of a crisp set (i.e., conventional set) in terms of a pair of sets which give the
                lower and the upper approximation of the original set. In the standard version of rough set theory
                (Pawlak 1991), the lower- and upper-approximation sets are crisp sets, but in other variations, the
                approximating sets may be fuzzy sets.

                    Let U = {O1, O2, O3, O4, O5} be the universal set of the objects.
                    <br />Any set X ⊆ U is called a concept.
                    ‘Attribute-1’ induces a relation R on U thus dividing it into two concepts C1 = {O1, O2, O4} and C2
                    =
                    {O3, O5}. These concepts C1 and C2 are clearly explainable by the knowledge using ‘Attribute-1’. Now
                    consider a concept C = {O1, O4} which can not be explained by the knowledge. Hence, we try to see if
                    we
                    can approximately explain the concepts using Rough sets.

                    Now, the concept C = {O1, O4} can not be explained by the knowledge. To explain the concept, we
                    define lower and upper approximations to the concept. The lower approximation contains the elements
                    that can be classified with complete certainty as the members of C. The upper approximation includes
                    the elements that can be classified as the members of C with any certainty. Any concept whose lower
                    and upper approximations are equal is called an R-definable concept. In the following article, we’ll
                    look into some basic topics from Discrete Mathematics that are essential for Rough sets.
